    Reference to a channel that will be used to create the subscription You can specify only the following fields of the ObjectReference: - Kind - APIVersion - Name The resource pointed by this ObjectReference must meet the contract to the ChannelableSpec duck type. If the resource does not meet this contract it will be reflected in the Subscription's status.  This field is immutable. We have no good answer on what happens to the events that are currently in the channel being consumed from and what the semantics there should be. For now, you can always delete the Subscription and recreate it to point to a different channel, giving the user more control over what semantics should be used (drain the channel first, possibly have events dropped, etc.)
