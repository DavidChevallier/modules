    Attributes
    ----------
    computeEnvironmentOrder : [BatchAwsCrossplaneIoV1alpha1JobQueueSpecForProviderComputeEnvironmentOrderItems0], default is Undefined, required
        The set of compute environments mapped to a job queue and their order relative to each other. The job scheduler uses this parameter to determine which compute environment should run a specific job. Compute environments must be in the VALID state before you can associate them with a job queue. You can associate up to three compute environments with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (EC2 or SPOT) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed. 
         All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share the same architecture. Batch doesn't support mixing compute environment architecture types in a single job queue. 
         ComputeEnvironmentOrder is a required field
    desiredState : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Custom parameter to control the state of the job queue. The valid values are ENABLED or DISABLED. 
         The state of the job queue. If the job queue state is ENABLED, it is able to accept jobs. If the job queue state is DISABLED, new jobs can't be added to the queue, but jobs already in the queue can finish.
    priority : int, default is Undefined, required
        The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a higher integer value for the priority parameter) are evaluated first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is determined in descending order. For example, a job queue with a priority value of 10 is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority value of 1. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (EC2 or SPOT) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.
    region : str, default is Undefined, required
        Region is which region the JobQueue will be created.
    schedulingPolicyARN : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fair share scheduling policy. If this parameter is specified, the job queue uses a fair share scheduling policy. If this parameter isn't specified, the job queue uses a first in, first out (FIFO) scheduling policy. After a job queue is created, you can replace but can't remove the fair share scheduling policy. The format is aws:Partition:batch:Region:Account:scheduling-policy/Name . An example is aws:aws:batch:us-west-2:012345678910:scheduling-policy/MySchedulingPolicy.
    tags : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        The tags that you apply to the job queue to help you categorize and organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. For more information, see Tagging your Batch resources (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/using-tags.html) in Batch User Guide.
