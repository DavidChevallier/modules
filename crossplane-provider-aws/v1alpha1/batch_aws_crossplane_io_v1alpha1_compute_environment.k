    computeResources : BatchAwsCrossplaneIoV1alpha1ComputeEnvironmentSpecForProviderComputeResources, default is Undefined, optional
        compute resources
    desiredState : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Custom parameter to control the state of the compute environment. The valid values are ENABLED or DISABLED. 
         If the state is ENABLED, then the Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand. 
         If the state is DISABLED, then the Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a STARTING or RUNNING state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the DISABLED state don't scale out. However, they scale in to minvCpus value after instances become idle.
    instanceRole : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The Amazon ECS instance profile applied to Amazon EC2 instances in a compute environment. You can specify the short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an instance profile. For example, ecsInstanceRole or arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:instance-profile/ecsInstanceRole . For more information, see Amazon ECS Instance Role (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/instance_IAM_role.html) in the Batch User Guide. Only applicable to MANGED CE of type EC2 or SPOT. This field can be updated for CE only with Allocation Strategy BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE or SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED. 
         This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.
    instanceRoleRef : BatchAwsCrossplaneIoV1alpha1ComputeEnvironmentSpecForProviderInstanceRoleRef, default is Undefined, optional
        instance role ref
    instanceRoleSelector : BatchAwsCrossplaneIoV1alpha1ComputeEnvironmentSpecForProviderInstanceRoleSelector, default is Undefined, optional
        instance role selector
    region : str, default is Undefined, required
        Region is which region the ComputeEnvironment will be created.

        SecurityGroupIDRefs is a list of references to SecurityGroups used to set the SecurityGroupIDs.
    securityGroupIdSelector : BatchAwsCrossplaneIoV1alpha1ComputeEnvironmentSpecForProviderSecurityGroupIDSelector, default is Undefined, optional
        security group Id selector
    securityGroupIds : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        The Amazon EC2 security groups associated with instances launched in the compute environment. One or more security groups must be specified, either in securityGroupIds or using a launch template referenced in launchTemplate. This parameter is required for jobs that are running on Fargate resources and must contain at least one security group. Fargate doesn't support launch templates. If security groups are specified using both securityGroupIds and launchTemplate, the values in securityGroupIds are used. For a MANGED CE of type EC2 or SPOT to be able to update this field Allocation Strategy BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE or SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED is required.
    serviceRoleARN : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows Batch to make calls to other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf. For more information, see Batch service IAM role (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/service_IAM_role.html) If the compute environment has a service-linked role, it can't be changed to use a regular IAM role. Likewise, if the compute environment has a regular IAM role, it can't be changed to use a service-linked role. If your specified role has a path other than /, then you must either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. Depending on how you created your Batch service role, its ARN might contain the service-role path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the service-role path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments
    serviceRoleARNRef : BatchAwsCrossplaneIoV1alpha1ComputeEnvironmentSpecForProviderServiceRoleARNRef, default is Undefined, optional
        service role a r n ref
    serviceRoleARNSelector : BatchAwsCrossplaneIoV1alpha1ComputeEnvironmentSpecForProviderServiceRoleARNSelector, default is Undefined, optional

        spot i a m fleet role ref
    spotIamFleetRole : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet IAM role applied to a SPOT compute environment. This role is required if the allocation strategy set to BEST_FIT or if the allocation strategy isn't specified. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet Role (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/spot_fleet_IAM_role.html) in the Batch User Guide. 
         This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified. 
         To tag your Spot Instances on creation, the Spot Fleet IAM role specified here must use the newer AmazonEC2SpotFleetTaggingRole managed policy. The previously recommended AmazonEC2SpotFleetRole managed policy doesn't have the required permissions to tag Spot Instances. For more information, see Spot Instances not tagged on creation (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html#spot-instance-no-tag) in the Batch User Guide.
    spotIamFleetRoleSelector : BatchAwsCrossplaneIoV1alpha1ComputeEnvironmentSpecForProviderSpotIamFleetRoleSelector, default is Undefined, optional
        spot iam fleet role selector
    subnetIdRefs : [BatchAwsCrossplaneIoV1alpha1ComputeEnvironmentSpecForProviderSubnetIDRefsItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        SubnetIDRefs is a list of references to SubnetIDs used to set the SubnetIDs.
    subnetIdSelector : BatchAwsCrossplaneIoV1alpha1ComputeEnvironmentSpecForProviderSubnetIDSelector, default is Undefined, optional
        subnet Id selector
    subnetIds : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        The VPC subnets where the compute resources are launched. These subnets must be within the same VPC. Fargate compute resources can contain up to 16 subnets. For more information, see VPCs and Subnets (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html) in the Amazon VPC User Guide. (Subnets is originally a field of ComputeResources) Subnets is a required field for CE type MANAGED. For a MANGED CE of type EC2 or SPOT to be able to update this field Allocation Strategy BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE or SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED is required.
    tags : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        The tags that you apply to the compute environment to help you categorize and organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. For more information, see Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in Amazon Web Services General Reference. 
         These tags can be updated or removed using the TagResource (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html) and UntagResource (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_UntagResource.html) API operations. These tags don't propagate to the underlying compute resources.
    type_ : str, default is Undefined, required
        The type of the compute environment: MANAGED or UNMANAGED. For more information, see Compute Environments (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html) in the Batch User Guide.
    unmanagedvCPUs : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The maximum number of vCPUs for an unmanaged compute environment. This parameter is only used for fair share scheduling to reserve vCPU capacity for new share identifiers. If this parameter isn't provided for a fair share job queue, no vCPU capacity is reserved. 
         This parameter is only supported when the type parameter is set to UNMANAGED.
    updatePolicy : BatchAwsCrossplaneIoV1alpha1ComputeEnvironmentSpecForProviderUpdatePolicy, default is Undefined, optional
        update policy
    updateToLatestImageVersion : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Specifies whether the AMI ID is updated to the latest one that's supported by Batch when the compute environment has an infrastructure update. The default value is false. Only applicable to MANGED CE of type EC2 or SPOT. This field requires an update request to be set and it can be updated for CE only with Allocation Strategy BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE or SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED. Also to get this field changed, you need to include another change to trigger an update. 
         If an AMI ID is specified in the imageIdOverride parameters or by the launch template specified in the launchTemplate parameter, this parameter is ignored. For more information on updating AMI IDs during an infrastructure update, see Updating the AMI ID (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html#updating-compute-environments-ami) in the Batch User Guide. 
         When updating a compute environment, changing this setting requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see Updating compute environments (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html) in the Batch User Guide.
