    Attributes
    ----------
    availabilityZoneName : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Used to create a file system that uses One Zone storage classes. It specifies the Amazon Web Services Availability Zone in which to create the file system. Use the format us-east-1a to specify the Availability Zone. For more information about One Zone storage classes, see Using EFS storage classes (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/storage-classes.html) in the Amazon EFS User Guide. 
         One Zone storage classes are not available in all Availability Zones in Amazon Web Services Regions where Amazon EFS is available.
    backup : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Specifies whether automatic backups are enabled on the file system that you are creating. Set the value to true to enable automatic backups. If you are creating a file system that uses One Zone storage classes, automatic backups are enabled by default. For more information, see Automatic backups (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/awsbackup.html#automatic-backups) in the Amazon EFS User Guide. 
         Default is false. However, if you specify an AvailabilityZoneName, the default is true. 
         Backup is not available in all Amazon Web Services Regions where Amazon EFS is available.
    encrypted : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        A Boolean value that, if true, creates an encrypted file system. When creating an encrypted file system, you have the option of specifying an existing Key Management Service key (KMS key). If you don't specify a KMS key, then the default KMS key for Amazon EFS, /aws/elasticfilesystem, is used to protect the encrypted file system.
    kmsKeyID : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The ID of the KMS key that you want to use to protect the encrypted file system. This parameter is required only if you want to use a non-default KMS key. If this parameter is not specified, the default KMS key for Amazon EFS is used. You can specify a KMS key ID using the following formats: 
         * Key ID - A unique identifier of the key, for example 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab. 
         * ARN - An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the key, for example arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab. 
         * Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for example alias/projectKey1. 
         * Key alias ARN - An ARN for a key alias, for example arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1. 
         If you use KmsKeyId, you must set the CreateFileSystemRequest$Encrypted parameter to true. 
         EFS accepts only symmetric KMS keys. You cannot use asymmetric KMS keys with Amazon EFS file systems.
    kmsKeyIdRef : EfsAwsCrossplaneIoV1alpha1FileSystemSpecForProviderKmsKeyIDRef, default is Undefined, optional
        kms key Id ref
    kmsKeyIdSelector : EfsAwsCrossplaneIoV1alpha1FileSystemSpecForProviderKmsKeyIDSelector, default is Undefined, optional
        kms key Id selector
    performanceMode : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The performance mode of the file system. We recommend generalPurpose performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the maxIO performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the file system has been created. 
         The maxIO mode is not supported on file systems using One Zone storage classes.
    provisionedThroughputInMibps : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to provision for a file system that you're creating. Valid values are 1-1024. Required if ThroughputMode is set to provisioned. The upper limit for throughput is 1024 MiB/s. You can get this limit increased by contacting AWS Support. For more information, see Amazon EFS Limits That You Can Increase (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/limits.html#soft-limits) in the Amazon EFS User Guide.
    region : str, default is Undefined, required
        Region is which region the FileSystem will be created.
    tags : [EfsAwsCrossplaneIoV1alpha1FileSystemSpecForProviderTagsItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        Use to create one or more tags associated with the file system. Each tag is a user-defined key-value pair. Name your file system on creation by including a "Key":"Name","Value":"{value}" key-value pair. Each key must be unique. For more information, see Tagging Amazon Web Services resources (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide.
    throughputMode : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Specifies the throughput mode for the file system, either bursting or provisioned. If you set ThroughputMode to provisioned, you must also set a value for ProvisionedThroughputInMibps. After you create the file system, you can decrease your file system's throughput in Provisioned Throughput mode or change between the throughput modes, as long as itâ€™s been more than 24 hours since the last decrease or throughput mode change. For more information, see Specifying throughput with provisioned mode (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#provisioned-throughput) in the Amazon EFS User Guide. 
         Default is bursting.
