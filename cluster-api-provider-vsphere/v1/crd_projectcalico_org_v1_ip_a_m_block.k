    apiVersion : str, default is "crd.projectcalico.org/v1", required
        APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
    kind : str, default is "IPAMBlock", required
        Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

    IPAMBlockSpec contains the specification for an IPAMBlock resource.

    Attributes
    ----------
    affinity : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Affinity of the block, if this block has one. If set, it will be of the form "host:<hostname>". If not set, this block is not affine to a host.
    allocations : [int], default is Undefined, required
        Array of allocations in-use within this block. nil entries mean the allocation is free. For non-nil entries at index i, the index is the ordinal of the allocation within this block and the value is the index of the associated attributes in the Attributes array.
    attributes : [CrdProjectcalicoOrgV1IPAMBlockSpecAttributesItems0], default is Undefined, required
        Attributes is an array of arbitrary metadata associated with allocations in the block. To find attributes for a given allocation, use the value of the allocation's entry in the Allocations array as the index of the element in this array.
    cidr : str, default is Undefined, required
        The block's CIDR.
    deleted : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Deleted is an internal boolean used to workaround a limitation in the Kubernetes API whereby deletion will not return a conflict error if the block has been updated. It should not be set manually.
    sequenceNumber : int, default is Undefined, optional
        We store a sequence number that is updated each time the block is written. Each allocation will also store the sequence number of the block at the time of its creation. When releasing an IP, passing the sequence number associated with the allocation allows us to protect against a race condition and ensure the IP hasn't been released and re-allocated since the release request.
    sequenceNumberForAllocation : {str:int}, default is Undefined, optional
        Map of allocated ordinal within the block to sequence number of the block at the time of allocation. Kubernetes does not allow numerical keys for maps, so the key is cast to a string.
    strictAffinity : bool, default is Undefined, required
        StrictAffinity on the IPAMBlock is deprecated and no longer used by the code. Use IPAMConfig StrictAffinity instead.
    unallocated : [int], default is Undefined, required
        Unallocated is an ordered list of allocations which are free in the block.
