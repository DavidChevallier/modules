         # Amazon Aurora 
         Default: 3306 
         Valid values: 1150-65535 
         Type: Integer
    preSignedURL : str, default is Undefined, optional
        When you are creating a read replica from one Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region to another or from one China Amazon Web Services Region to another, the URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica API operation in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source DB instance. 
         This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions and China Amazon Web Services Regions. It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services Regions. 
         This setting applies only when replicating from a source DB instance. Source DB clusters aren't supported in Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions and China Amazon Web Services Regions. 
         You must specify this parameter when you create an encrypted read replica from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon RDS API. Don't specify PreSignedUrl when you are creating an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region. 
         The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted source DB instance. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values: 
         - DestinationRegion - The Amazon Web Services Region that the encrypted read replica is created in. This Amazon Web Services Region is the same one where the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation is called that contains this presigned URL. For example, if you create an encrypted DB instance in the us-west-1 Amazon Web Services Region, from a source DB instance in the us-east-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then you call the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For this example, the DestinationRegion in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region. 
         - KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the read replica in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL. 
         - SourceDBInstanceIdentifier - The DB instance identifier for the encrypted DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are creating an encrypted read replica from a DB instance in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your SourceDBInstanceIdentifier looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:instance:mysql-instance1-20161115. 
         To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html). 
         If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for the CLI) instead of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRegion autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region. 
         SourceRegion isn't supported for SQL Server, because Amazon RDS for SQL Server doesn't support cross-Region read replicas. 
         This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
    preferredBackupWindow : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated backups are enabled, using the BackupRetentionPeriod parameter. The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region. For more information, see Backup window (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.html#USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.BackupWindow) in the Amazon RDS User Guide. 
         # Amazon Aurora 
         Not applicable. The daily time range for creating automated backups is managed by the DB cluster. 
         Constraints: 
         - Must be in the format hh24:mi-hh24:mi. 
         - Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). 
         - Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window. 
         - Must be at least 30 minutes.
    preferredMaintenanceWindow : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The time range each week during which system maintenance can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). For more information, see Amazon RDS Maintenance Window (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.html#Concepts.DBMaintenance). 
         Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi 
         The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region, occurring on a random day of the week. 
         Valid Days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun. 
         Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window.
    processorFeatures : [RdsServicesK8sAwsV1alpha1DBInstanceSpecProcessorFeaturesItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB instance class of the DB instance. 
         This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom. 
         # Amazon Aurora 
         Not applicable.
    promotionTier : int, default is Undefined, optional
        A value that specifies the order in which an Aurora Replica is promoted to the primary instance after a failure of the existing primary instance. For more information, see Fault Tolerance for an Aurora DB Cluster (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Managing.Backups.html#Aurora.Managing.FaultTolerance) in the Amazon Aurora User Guide. 
         This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom. 
         Default: 1 
         Valid Values: 0 - 15
    publiclyAccessible : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        A value that indicates whether the DB instance is publicly accessible. 
         When the DB instance is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB instance's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from outside of the DB instance's VPC. Access to the DB instance is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the DB instance doesn't permit it. 
         When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. 
         Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether DBSubnetGroupName is specified. 
         If DBSubnetGroupName isn't specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't specified, the following applies: 
         - If the default VPC in the target Region doesnâ€™t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB instance is private. 
         - If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB instance is public. 
         If DBSubnetGroupName is specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't specified, the following applies: 
         - If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesnâ€™t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB instance is private. 
         - If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB instance is public.
    replicaMode : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The open mode of the replica database: mounted or read-only. 
         This parameter is only supported for Oracle DB instances. 
         Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. The main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. The primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard to transmit information to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a mounted replica can't serve a read-only workload. 
         You can create a combination of mounted and read-only DB replicas for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see Working with Oracle Read Replicas for Amazon RDS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.html) in the Amazon RDS User Guide. 
         For RDS Custom, you must specify this parameter and set it to mounted. The value won't be set by default. After replica creation, you can manage the open mode manually.
    sourceDBInstanceIdentifier : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The identifier of the DB instance that will act as the source for the read replica. Each DB instance can have up to 15 read replicas, with the exception of Oracle and SQL Server, which can have up to five. 
         Constraints: 
         - Must be the identifier of an existing MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server DB instance. 
         - Can't be specified if the SourceDBClusterIdentifier parameter is also specified. 
         - For the limitations of Oracle read replicas, see Version and licensing considerations for RDS for Oracle replicas (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.limitations.html#oracle-read-replicas.limitations.versions-and-licenses) in the Amazon RDS User Guide. 
         - For the limitations of SQL Server read replicas, see Read replica limitations with SQL Server (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/SQLServer.ReadReplicas.html#SQLServer.ReadReplicas.Limitations) in the Amazon RDS User Guide. 
         - The specified DB instance must have automatic backups enabled, that is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0. 
         - If the source DB instance is in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the read replica, specify a valid DB instance identifier. 
         - If the source DB instance is in a different Amazon Web Services Region from the read replica, specify a valid DB instance ARN. For more information, see Constructing an ARN for Amazon RDS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.ARN.html#USER_Tagging.ARN.Constructing) in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This doesn't apply to SQL Server or RDS Custom, which don't support cross-Region replicas.
    sourceRegion : str, default is Undefined, optional
        SourceRegion is the source region where the resource exists. This is not sent over the wire and is only used for presigning. This value should always have the same region as the source ARN.
    storageEncrypted : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        A value that indicates whether the DB instance is encrypted. By default, it isn't encrypted. 
         For RDS Custom instances, either set this parameter to true or leave it unset. If you set this parameter to false, RDS reports an error. 
         # Amazon Aurora 
         Not applicable. The encryption for DB instances is managed by the DB cluster.
    storageThroughput : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Specifies the storage throughput value for the DB instance. 
         This setting applies only to the gp3 storage type. 
         This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom or Amazon Aurora.
    storageType : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Specifies the storage type to be associated with the DB instance. 
         Valid values: gp2 | gp3 | io1 | standard 
         If you specify io1 or gp3, you must also include a value for the Iops parameter. 
         Default: io1 if the Iops parameter is specified, otherwise gp2 
         # Amazon Aurora 
         Not applicable. Storage is managed by the DB cluster.
    tags : [RdsServicesK8sAwsV1alpha1DBInstanceSpecTagsItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        Tags to assign to the DB instance.
    tdeCredentialARN : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The ARN from the key store with which to associate the instance for TDE encryption.

    useDefaultProcessorFeatures : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        A value that indicates whether the DB instance class of the DB instance uses its default processor features. 
         This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
    vpcSecurityGroupIDs : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        A list of Amazon EC2 VPC security groups to associate with this DB instance. 
         # Amazon Aurora 
         Not applicable. The associated list of EC2 VPC security groups is managed by the DB cluster. 
         Default: The default EC2 VPC security group for the DB subnet group's VPC.

    Contains the processor features of a DB instance class. 
     To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature name for the Name parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the threadsPerCore feature name for the Name parameter. 
     You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions: 
     - CreateDBInstance 
     - ModifyDBInstance 
     - RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot 
     - RestoreDBInstanceFromS3 
     - RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime 
     You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions action and specifying the instance class for the DBInstanceClass parameter. 
     In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information: 
     - DescribeDBInstances 
     - DescribeDBSnapshots 
     - DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications 
     If you call DescribeDBInstances, ProcessorFeature returns non-null values only if the following conditions are met: 
     - You are accessing an Oracle DB instance. 
     - Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU cores and threads per core. 
     - The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value. 
     For more information, see Configuring the Processor of the DB Instance Class (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html#USER_ConfigureProcessor) in the Amazon RDS User Guide.
