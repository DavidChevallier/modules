    Required. Destination specification of the Connectivity Test.

    You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute
    Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the
    destination location.

    Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP
    location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
    endpoint from route information.

    If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has
    multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a
    destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination
    interface.

    A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location
    is ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you
    don't intend to test.

    You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine

    Examples: If the source IP address is an internal IP address within
    a Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must
    also specify the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance,
    which already contains its internal IP address and VPC network
    information.

    If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then
    you must provide the destination VPC network.

    If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
    network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to
    identify the endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP
    address or VPC network.
