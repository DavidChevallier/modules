    description : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Human readable description for better understanding an intent like its scope, content, result etc. Maximum character limit: 140 characters.
    displayName : str, default is Undefined, required
        The human-readable name of the intent, unique within the agent.
    isFallback : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Indicates whether this is a fallback intent. Currently only default fallback intent is allowed in the agent, which is added upon agent creation.
        Adding training phrases to fallback intent is useful in the case of requests that are mistakenly matched, since training phrases assigned to fallback intents act as negative examples that triggers no-match event.
    languageCode : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. The language of the following fields in intent:
        Intent.training_phrases.parts.text
        If not specified, the agent's default language is used. Many languages are supported. Note: languages must be enabled in the agent before they can be used.
    parameters : [DialogflowcxCnrmCloudGoogleComV1alpha1DialogflowCXIntentSpecParametersItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        The collection of parameters associated with the intent.
    parent : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. The agent to create an intent for.
        Format: projects/<Project ID>/locations/<Location ID>/agents/<Agent ID>.
    priority : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The priority of this intent. Higher numbers represent higher priorities.
        If the supplied value is unspecified or 0, the service translates the value to 500,000, which corresponds to the Normal priority in the console.
        If the supplied value is negative, the intent is ignored in runtime detect intent requests.
    resourceID : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. Optional. The service-generated name of the resource. Used for acquisition only. Leave unset to create a new resource.
    trainingPhrases : [DialogflowcxCnrmCloudGoogleComV1alpha1DialogflowCXIntentSpecTrainingPhrasesItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        The collection of training phrases the agent is trained on to identify the intent.

        If the training phrase does not need to be annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the Part.text field set.
        If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways:
        Part.text is set to a part of the phrase that has no parameters.
        Part.text is set to a part of the phrase that you want to annotate, and the parameterId field is set.
