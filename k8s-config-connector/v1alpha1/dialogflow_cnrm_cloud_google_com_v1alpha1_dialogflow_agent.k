        APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
    kind : str, default is "DialogflowAgent", required
        Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

    Attributes
    ----------
    apiVersion : str, default is Undefined, optional
        API version displayed in Dialogflow console. If not specified, V2 API is assumed. Clients are free to query
        different service endpoints for different API versions. However, bots connectors and webhook calls will follow
        the specified API version.
        * API_VERSION_V1: Legacy V1 API.
        * API_VERSION_V2: V2 API.
        * API_VERSION_V2_BETA_1: V2beta1 API. Possible values: ["API_VERSION_V1", "API_VERSION_V2", "API_VERSION_V2_BETA_1"].
    avatarUri : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The URI of the agent's avatar, which are used throughout the Dialogflow console. When an image URL is entered
        into this field, the Dialogflow will save the image in the backend. The address of the backend image returned
        from the API will be shown in the [avatarUriBackend] field.
    classificationThreshold : float, default is Undefined, optional
        To filter out false positive results and still get variety in matched natural language inputs for your agent,
        you can tune the machine learning classification threshold. If the returned score value is less than the threshold
        value, then a fallback intent will be triggered or, if there are no fallback intents defined, no intent will be
        triggered. The score values range from 0.0 (completely uncertain) to 1.0 (completely certain). If set to 0.0, the
        default of 0.3 is used.
    defaultLanguageCode : str, default is Undefined, required
        Immutable. The default language of the agent as a language tag. [See Language Support](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/reference/language)
        for a list of the currently supported language codes. This field cannot be updated after creation.
    description : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The description of this agent. The maximum length is 500 characters. If exceeded, the request is rejected.
    displayName : str, default is Undefined, required
        The name of this agent.
    enableLogging : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Determines whether this agent should log conversation queries.
    matchMode : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Determines how intents are detected from user queries.
        * MATCH_MODE_HYBRID: Best for agents with a small number of examples in intents and/or wide use of templates
        syntax and composite entities.
        * MATCH_MODE_ML_ONLY: Can be used for agents with a large number of examples in intents, especially the ones
        using @sys.any or very large developer entities. Possible values: ["MATCH_MODE_HYBRID", "MATCH_MODE_ML_ONLY"].
    resourceID : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. Optional. The project of the resource. Used for creation and acquisition. When unset, the value of `metadata.name` is used as the default.
    supportedLanguageCodes : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        The list of all languages supported by this agent (except for the defaultLanguageCode).
    tier : str, default is Undefined, optional
        tier
    timeZone : str, default is Undefined, required
        The time zone of this agent from the [time zone database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones), e.g., America/New_York,
        Europe/Paris.
