    concurrency : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Maximum number of queries that are allowed to run concurrently in this reservation. This is a soft limit due to asynchronous nature of the system and various optimizations for small queries. Default value is 0 which means that concurrency will be automatically set based on the reservation size.
    edition : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. The edition type. Valid values are STANDARD, ENTERPRISE, ENTERPRISE_PLUS.
    ignoreIdleSlots : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        If false, any query using this reservation will use idle slots from other reservations within
        the same admin project. If true, a query using this reservation will execute with the slot
        capacity specified above at most.
    location : str, default is Undefined, required
        Immutable. The geographic location where the transfer config should reside.
        Examples: US, EU, asia-northeast1. The default value is US.

        Applicable only for reservations located within one of the BigQuery multi-regions (US or EU).
        If set to true, this reservation is placed in the organization's secondary region which is designated for disaster recovery purposes. If false, this reservation is placed in the organization's default region.

    slotCapacity : int, default is Undefined, required
        Minimum slots available to this reservation. A slot is a unit of computational power in BigQuery, and serves as the
        unit of parallelism. Queries using this reservation might use more slots during runtime if ignoreIdleSlots is set to false.
