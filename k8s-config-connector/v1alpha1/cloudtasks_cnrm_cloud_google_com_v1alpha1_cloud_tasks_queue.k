    Rate limits for task dispatches.

    The queue's actual dispatch rate is the result of:

    * Number of tasks in the queue
    * User-specified throttling: rateLimits, retryConfig, and the queue's state.
    * System throttling due to 429 (Too Many Requests) or 503 (Service
      Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to

    maxBurstSize : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The max burst size.

        Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are
        in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high
        rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits
        resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time.
    maxConcurrentDispatches : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to
        be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been

        concurrent requests decreases.

    Settings that determine the retry behavior.

    maxAttempts : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Number of attempts per task.

        Cloud Tasks will attempt the task maxAttempts times (that is, if
        the first attempt fails, then there will be maxAttempts - 1
        retries). Must be >= -1.

        If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick
        the default.

        -1 indicates unlimited attempts.
    maxBackoff : str, default is Undefined, optional
        A task will be scheduled for retry between minBackoff and
        maxBackoff duration after it fails, if the queue's RetryConfig
        specifies that the task should be retried.
    maxDoublings : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The time between retries will double maxDoublings times.

        A task's retry interval starts at minBackoff, then doubles maxDoublings times,
        then increases linearly, and finally retries retries at intervals of maxBackoff
        up to maxAttempts times.
    maxRetryDuration : str, default is Undefined, optional
        If positive, maxRetryDuration specifies the time limit for
        retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first
        attempted. Once maxRetryDuration time has passed and the task has
        been attempted maxAttempts times, no further attempts will be
        made and the task will be deleted.

    minBackoff : str, default is Undefined, optional
        A task will be scheduled for retry between minBackoff and
