        An ordered list of Ed25519 public keys to use for validating signed requests.
        You must specify 'public_keys' or 'validation_shared_keys' (or both). The keys in 'public_keys' are checked first.
        You may specify no more than one Google-managed public key.
        If you specify 'public_keys', you must specify at least one (1) key and may specify up to three (3) keys.

        Ed25519 public keys are not secret, and only allow Google to validate a request was signed by your corresponding private key.
