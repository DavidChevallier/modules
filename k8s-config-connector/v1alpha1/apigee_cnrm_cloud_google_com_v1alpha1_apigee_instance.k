    consumerAcceptList : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. Optional. Customer accept list represents the list of projects (id/number) on customer
        side that can privately connect to the service attachment. It is an optional field
        which the customers can provide during the instance creation. By default, the customer
        project associated with the Apigee organization will be included to the list.
    description : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. Description of the instance.
    diskEncryptionKeyName : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. Customer Managed Encryption Key (CMEK) used for disk and volume encryption. Required for Apigee paid subscriptions only.

    displayName : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. Display name of the instance.
    ipRange : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. IP range represents the customer-provided CIDR block of length 22 that will be used for
        the Apigee instance creation. This optional range, if provided, should be freely
        available as part of larger named range the customer has allocated to the Service
        Networking peering. If this is not provided, Apigee will automatically request for any
        available /22 CIDR block from Service Networking. The customer should use this CIDR block
        for configuring their firewall needs to allow traffic from Apigee.
        Input format: "a.b.c.d/22".
    location : str, default is Undefined, required
        Immutable. Required. Compute Engine location where the instance resides.
    orgId : str, default is Undefined, required
        Immutable. The Apigee Organization associated with the Apigee instance,
        in the format 'organizations/{{org_name}}'.
    peeringCidrRange : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. The size of the CIDR block range that will be reserved by the instance. For valid values,
