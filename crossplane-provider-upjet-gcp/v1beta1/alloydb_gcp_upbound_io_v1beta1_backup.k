    encryptionConfig : [AlloydbGcpUpboundIoV1beta1BackupStatusAtProviderEncryptionConfigItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        EncryptionConfig describes the encryption config of a cluster or a backup that is encrypted with a CMEK (customer-managed encryption key).
        Structure is documented below.
    encryptionInfo : [AlloydbGcpUpboundIoV1beta1BackupStatusAtProviderEncryptionInfoItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        EncryptionInfo describes the encryption information of a cluster or a backup.

    expiryQuantity : [AlloydbGcpUpboundIoV1beta1BackupStatusAtProviderExpiryQuantityItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        Output only. The QuantityBasedExpiry of the backup, specified by the backup's retention policy.
        Once the expiry quantity is over retention, the backup is eligible to be garbage collected.
        Structure is documented below.
    expiryTime : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Output only. The time at which after the backup is eligible to be garbage collected.
        It is the duration specified by the backup's retention policy, added to the backup's createTime.
    id : str, default is Undefined, optional
        an identifier for the resource with format projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backups/{{backup_id}}
    labels : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        User-defined labels for the alloydb backup. An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.
    location : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The location where the alloydb backup should reside.
    name : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Output only. The name of the backup resource with the format: * projects/{project}/locations/{region}/backups/{backupId}
    project : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
        If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
    reconciling : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Output only. Reconciling (https://google.aip.dev/128#reconciliation), if true, indicates that the service is actively updating the resource.
        This can happen due to user-triggered updates or system actions like failover or maintenance.
    sizeBytes : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Output only. The size of the backup in bytes.
    state : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Output only. The current state of the backup.
    terraformLabels : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        The combination of labels configured directly on the resource
        and default labels configured on the provider.
    $type : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The backup type, which suggests the trigger for the backup.
        Possible values are: TYPE_UNSPECIFIED, ON_DEMAND, AUTOMATED, CONTINUOUS.
    uid : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Output only. The system-generated UID of the resource. The UID is assigned when the resource is created, and it is retained until it is deleted.
    updateTime : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Output only. Update time stamp. A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to nine fractional digits.
        Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".
